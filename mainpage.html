							<h4 class="card-title zaq">Origin of Pizza</h4>
							<p class="xaq"> The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with toppings. The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. The precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century. However, pizza was mainly eaten in the province of Italy and by immigrants from there.[ This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>

										<p class="cheese1">Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.</p>
									<li class= "pepperoni">pepperoni</li>
										<p class="pepperoni1">Pepperoni, also known as pepperoni sausage, is an American variety of salami, usually made from cured pork and beef mixed together.Pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly smoky, and bright red in color. Thinly sliced pepperoni is a popular pizza topping in American-style pizzerias and is used as filling in the West Virginia pepperoni roll. It is also used to make some varieties of submarine sandwiches.</p>
									<li class= "BBQ">BBQ Chicken!</li>
